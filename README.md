This project, crafted with HTML5 Canvas, is a testament to my learning journey in web graphics and animation. 
Following the insightful "HTML5 Canvas CRASH COURSE for Beginners" by Frank Dvorak/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y&t=1s,
I not only mastered the basics of Canvas but also 
infused my creativity into the project. 
While the foundation was tutorial-based, 
the adaptations and problem-solving skills developed during this project highlight my 
ability to learn, adapt, and innovate in web development.
